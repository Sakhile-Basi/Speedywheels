# Speedy Wheels — Car Rental (WE22)

This is a small PHP project for an employee dashboard/login for the Speedy Wheels car rental system.

Quick start

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in database credentials.
2. Ensure you have PHP and a webserver (WAMP) installed and running.
3. Place the project in your webroot (e.g., `C:\wamp64\www\WE22\carRental`).
4. Initialize a git repo and commit (this repo is not initialized by default).

Security

- Do NOT commit `.env` or `includes/db.php` if it contains credentials. These are ignored via `.gitignore`.

Notes

- If you want, I can initialize the git repository and make the first commit for you. Tell me whether you want a remote (GitHub) and provide the repo URL if so.
